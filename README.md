# QA Automation Playground

Welcome to the QA Automation Playground! This project is designed to help you practice your test automation skills using tools like Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, and more.

## Scenarios
1.  **Login & Registration**: Form handling, multi-step forms, and validation simulation.
2.  **Dynamic Table**: Handling tables with pagination, sorting, search, and dynamic row data.
3.  **File Upload/Download**: Interacting with file inputs (including drag-and-drop) and validating downloads.
4.  **Modals & Alerts**: Handling native browser alerts (alert, confirm, prompt) and custom HTML modals.
5.  **Drag & Drop**: Automating HTML5 drag-and-drop events.
6.  **iFrames**: Switching context between parent windows and nested iFrames.
7.  **Shadow DOM**: Locating and interacting with elements encapsulated within Shadow Roots (open mode).
8.  **API Calls**: Testing asynchronous UI updates driven by mocked API responses (varying delays and status codes).
9.  **Mouse Actions**: Simulating hover, right-click (context menu), double-click, and click-and-hold.
10. **Form Validation**: Testing HTML5 constraint validation, max length, and regex patterns.
11. **Progress Bar**: Synchronization practice using Explicit Waits (waiting for a process to complete).
12. **Scroll & Lazy Load**: Handling infinite scroll and elements that load dynamically upon scrolling.
13. **Dynamic ID**: Robust selector strategies for elements with changing IDs.
14. **Geolocation**: Mocking browser geolocation permissions and coordinates.
15. **Keyboard & Clipboard**: Testing keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+K) and reading/writing to the clipboard.
16. **New Tab / Window**: Handling multiple browser contexts and switching tabs.

## How to Run locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - Note: Some features (like local file access or strict CORS policies) might behave differently if you just open the file. It is recommended to run a simple local server.
   
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```
